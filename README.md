# 👋 Hi, I'm Chuck!

## 🔧 Industrial Automation Wizard
I make machines play nice and do what they’re supposed to—most of the time. With expertise in electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical systems, I’ve got a knack for turning chaos into efficiency.

## 🤖 PLC Whisperer
Whether it’s Siemens, Allen-Bradley, Beckhoff, or a rogue Schneider Electric system, I speak their language (even if they don’t always want to listen).

## ⚙️ Instrumentation Extraordinaire
From pressure to flow to "why is this sensor blinking?", I’ve calibrated, fixed, and debugged it all.

## 🏭 Industry Chameleon
I’ve worked in manufacturing, food and beverage, chemical, water treatment, and more. If it moves, measures, or makes something, odds are I’ve been there—hands-on and results-driven.

## 💡 Innovator & Problem-Solver
I bridge the gap between OT and IT, delivering solutions that actually work (and don’t need a 100-page manual).

### Joke:
**Why did the oscilloscope break up with the signal generator?**  
It said, "You're too unstable, and I just can't find the right frequency with you!"
